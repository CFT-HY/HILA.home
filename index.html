Hila (lattice in Finnish) is a C++ programming framework and suite of 
[Lattice Field Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_field_theory)
aimed at HPC simulations.  

Purpose: To make writing applications straightforward and intuitive, while producing optimized executables for 
different (super)computing platforms (parallelization with MPI, GPU computing with Cuda or HIP, AVX vectorization, 
etc.). **Write once -- run anywhere**.
