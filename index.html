<p class="lead">Hila (lattice in Finnish) is a C++ programming framework and suite of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_field_theory">Lattice Field Theory</a>
    aimed at HPC simulations.</p>  
    
<p class="lead">Purpose of HILA: to make writing applications straightforward and intuitive, while producing optimized executables for 
    different (super)computing platforms (parallelization with MPI, GPU computing with Cuda or HIP, AVX vectorization, 
    etc.). <p class="thick">Write once -- run anywhere</p>.</p>
