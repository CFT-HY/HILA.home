<p class="lead"> 
  Compilation of CFT simulation codes developed upon HILA logically requires two steps
</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
      <ul>
        <li>Compiling S2S transcompiler hilapp and install it onto desired path.</li>
        <li>Compiling simulation codes with necessary environment variables, which will invoke hardware architecture supports from HILA.</li>
      </ul>
</ul>

<p class="lead">
 HILA is developed on Debian/Ubuntu branch of 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy">GNU/Linux</a> operating system.
 It has been proven many times that HILA's utilities also works well on 
 <a href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9"> Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>
 as well as
 <a href="https://documentation.suse.com/en-us/sles/15-SP6/"> SUSE Linux Enterprise</a>.
 After necessary configurations, simulation codes of HILA also has been compiled on 
 <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/">FreeBSD</a> system, which is significantly different from Linux family of operating system 
 in the aspects of system components.
 Users and developers using HILA's APIs are welcomed to send their patches of their own systems back to HILA's repository, see more on 
 <a href="{{ "/community" | relative_url }}">community</a> about contributions and license.
</p>

<p class="lead">
  HILA's utilities, including hialpp, are configured and built through 
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU make</a>.
  On Debian/Ubuntu system, all necessary dependencies for building HILA can be easily installed through 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)">APT</a>, see details from
  <a href="{{ site.docs_url | append: '/dependencies_and_installation.html' }}">documentation</a>.
</p>

<p class="lead">
  In specific situation, compiling hilapp may be not easy or totally impossible on certain supercomputer platforms. 
  This problem is caused by lack of module support LLVM, which is necessary as described in 
  <a href="{{ "/about" | relative_url }}">About</a> page.
