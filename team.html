<p>
 Purpose: make writing applications straightforward and intuitive, while producing optimized executables for 
 different (super)computing platforms (parallelization with MPI, GPU computing with Cuda or HIP, AVX vectorization, 
 etc.).  Details of the parallelization and computing architecture are hidden from the user's view, and 
 all applications automatically run on present or future platform.
 Write once -- run anywhere.
</p>

<p class="mb-5">Hila is based on hila preprocessor "hilapp", which is a C++ source-to-source transformer using the 
    <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html">libtooling</a> toolbox of the
    <a href="https://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a> compiler.
    It converts application C++ to platform-specific C++ code,
    which is passed to appropriate compilers for the platforms.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes hila takes care of MPI layout and communications.  It lays out the 
    lattice fields differently for different computing platforms: 'array of structures' (standard),
    'array of structures of vectors' (AVX-type), or 'structure of arrays' (GPU-type).</p>
